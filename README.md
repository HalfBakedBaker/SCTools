# SCTools -

This is a quick 'half-baked' implementation of some tools for Star Citizen in Windows. 


After crashing my ship plenty of times due to typing in chat. I decided i wanted a feature similar to what we have in Forza only with 
the ability to customise the words youd like to say. 
This way i can click a single button and not have to worry about accidently turning my engines off ect...  

Keybind to show hide Tools & Quick chat menu  is "< + m"  Will move mouse to QuickChat when toggling QC visibile 
RMB + Drag to move the windows around

SCHUB = menu with buttons that allows the user to open new instances of SCQuickChat, SCTool & Quick Launch usefull websites related to SC.
The websites are opened in the users default browser. 



SCQuickChat = Allows the user to quickly send a pre defined message in chat at click of button.  (User Must have Chat open in order for it to work "F12")

save / load buttons to a text file that can be later be loaded.
   the user can open mutiple instances of the Quick Chat Tool to have as many buttons as they like.
   
Load / save Default 
  Will look for text file named "Default" in folder named "Saved" and load that at start. 
  If you wish to change the default save, there is a button that allows you to overwrite the default save with whatever buttons are currently displayed.


SCTool = Open menu with pre made buttons for the following  

Debug 0,1,2,3,4,sessioninfo,screenshot, emergency exit game (after 3 clicks)
