# SCTools -

This is a quick 'half-baked' implementation of some tools for Star Citizen in Windows. 


After crashing my ship plenty of times due to typing in chat i decided i wanted a feature similar to what we have in Forza only with 
the ability to customise the words youd like to say. This way i can click a single button and not have to worry about accidently turning my engines off ect...  

Keybind to show hide Tools & Quick chat menu  is "< + m"  Will move mouse to QuickChat when toggling QC visibile 
RMB + Drag to move the windows around

SCHUB = menu with buttons that allows the user to open new instances of SCQuickChat, SCTool & Quick Launch usefull websites related to SC.
The websites are opened in the users default browser so be sure to make sure your default browser is set to the one you want to use in game. 



SCQuickChat = Allow User to quickly send a pre defined message in chat at click of button.  (User Must have Chat open in order for it to work "F12")
save / load buttons to a text file that can be later be loaded.
   the user can open mutiple instances of the Quick Chat Tool to have as many buttons as they like ### TODO Improve scaling for buttons 
   as right now you cant change the size. 
  Load / save Default 
  Will look for text file named "Default" in folder named "Saved" and load that at start. 
  If you wish to change the default save, there is a button that allows you to overwrite the default save with whatever buttons are currently displayed.




SCTool = Open menu with pre made buttons for the following  
    Mobi Glass 
    Comlink
    map
    Camera
    Debug 0,1,2,3,4,sessioninfo,screenshot
    exit (after 3 clicks) ( types `quit[enter] into console)
