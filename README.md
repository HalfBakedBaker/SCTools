This is a quick 'half-baked' implementation of some tools for Star Citizen in Windows. 


After crashing my ship plenty of times due to typing in chat. I decided i wanted a feature similar to what we have in Forza with the "Link" feature. But with 
the added ability to customise the words you would like to say. 

This way i can click a single button and not have to worry about accidently turning my engines off, hitting cruise control ect...  

Keybind to show hide Tools & Quick chat menu  is "< + m"  Will move mouse to QuickChat when toggling visibile.

RMB + Drag to move the windows around

Sliders to controll opacity of the windows.

SCHUB = menu with buttons that allows the user to open new instances of SCQuickChat, SCTool & quickly launch usefull websites related to SC.
(The websites are opened in the users default browser.)  (am considering making a lightweight web browser for SC. But right now the default browser will do)

SCQuickChat = Allows the user to quickly send a pre defined message in chat at click of a button.  (User Must have Chat open in order for it to work "F12")

save / load buttons to a text file in a location of your choice.  
   the user can open mutiple instances of Quick Chat to have as many buttons as they like.
   
Load / save Default 
  Will look for text file named "Default" in folder named "Saved" and then load that at start. 
  If you wish to change the default save, there is a button in the sidebar that allows you to overwrite the default save with whatever buttons are currently displayed.

SCTool = Opens a menu with pre made buttons for the following:

Debug 0,1,2,3,4,sessioninfo,screenshot, emergency exit game (after 3 clicks)
